Research paper
==============

The research paper is split up into separate files corresponding to the different sections of the paper. This allows to organise the structure of the document in the main file while decluttering the text sections.
The different files are organised as follows:

    * :file:`refs.bib` contains the bibliography.
    * :file:`replication_report.tex` contains the main structure of the paper.
    * :file:`section_appendix.tex` contains the appendix.
    * :file:`section_baseline_model.tex` contains the section on the baseline model.
    * :file:`section_data.tex` contains the main section on data.
    * :file:`section_extended_model.tex` contains the section on the extended model.
    * :file:`section_introduction.tex` contains the introduction.

To declutter the latex files, the code for tables and figures is contained in the corresponding directories. Note that the file names correspond to the respective figure numbers in the original paper by Jermann and Quadrini (2012, :cite:`JERMANNfinancial`).
